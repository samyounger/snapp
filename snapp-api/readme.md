# Rails 5 Authentication


## Exercise

Your task is to practise what we have learnt today and replicate the Rails JWT authentication with the lesson notes.

**Bonus:**


- Create an app but instead of using a custom Auth class and Bcrypt, use [Devise_Token_Auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth)
- **This has not been tested with Rails 5** - This is practise for your project!
